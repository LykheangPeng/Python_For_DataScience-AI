# Python_For_DataScience-AI
By PENG Lykheang, Data Science & AI Expert and Lecturer, Faculty of Computer Science, Preah Shihamoniraja Buddhist University.

## Abtract
This course is designed to guide young academia students, professionals, and anyone keen to learn the Python programming language as a pathway to a career in data science and artificial intelligence. Drawing from my three years of experience in data science and artificial intelligence, I am motivated to share this knowledge with those who wish to step into the world of Data and AI. We will start with basic concepts to familiarize you with the key ideas in this rapidly growing industry. The course is divided into three main parts:
- Fundamentals of Python
- Python for Data Science
- Python in Artificial Intelligence
